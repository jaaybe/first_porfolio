                <p>
                            I've always had a love for computers, starting all the way back in middle school when we got the original IBM PC 5150.  
                            You know the one! with the 5 1/4 floppy drive and monochrome "green" screen. I learned DOS and Basic right away. 
                            Many years later, I'm still as passionate about computers, programming, and the advances they bring to our daily lives.
                            I have updated my knowledge of programming by completing the UCLA Coding Boot Camp, which enables me to be a full stack
                            developer.<br>
                            <br>   
                            10 Years ago, I started my own company called MOTION MUSIC.  It's a company that produces, designs, and executes live music shows 
                            and tours around the World.  My goal is to build applications and apply them to the business
                            I know and love by creating some much needed technological advances in the way Music Production is handled.
                            This includes everything from automation in financials and logistics, to big data collection to be able
                            to forcast trends in the entertainment industry.
